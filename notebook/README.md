# Notebook structure

This project aims to explore, analyze, and segment a sales dataset to uncover hidden patterns and support strategic decision-making. Below is a detailed description of each notebook and its purpose.

## 1. Data exploration

### `01-EDA.ipynb`
This notebook performs an exploratory analysis of the initial dataset. During this stage, distinct substructures within the data were identified, prompting the application of grouping and aggregation operations. The result is a more organized dataset that enables separate analysis of customers, products, and orders.

## 2. Clustering

### `02-a-Customers_Clustering.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on preprocessing customer-related data and applying various clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering, and DBSCAN. The results indicate that customers primarily group into two clusters, differentiated mainly by their `Segment`. However, no significant differences were found in other aspects.

### `02-b-Products_Clustering.ipynb`
Clustering is applied to the product dataset in this notebook. Due to the significantly high execution time, spectral clustering was omitted. Other algorithms were explored, but the resulting patterns were not sufficiently meaningful, leading to the development of an adjusted approach in the next notebook.

### `02-c-Products_Clustering.ipynb`
This notebook repeats the product clustering process with adjusted preprocessing to obtain more meaningful clusters. The clusters generated by K-Means were the most interpretable and were selected for further analysis in `03-a`.

### `02-d-Order_Clustering.ipynb`
Clustering is applied to the order dataset in this notebook. Similar to the product analysis, spectral clustering was omitted due to execution time constraints. K-Means clusters provided the most useful insights, distinguishing primarily by the economic profitability of orders. A detailed analysis of these clusters is performed in `03-b`.

## 3. Cluster analysis

### `03-a-Products_Analysis.ipynb`
This notebook performs an in-depth exploratory analysis of the product dataset, incorporating the clustering results. Key characteristics and patterns within the clusters are identified.

### `03-b-Order_Analysis.ipynb`
An exploratory analysis of the orders dataset is conducted in this notebook, with a focus on the clusters generated. Differences between the clusters, such as economic profitability, are studied to draw actionable conclusions.

## 4. Forecasting and time series

### `04-Forecasting.ipynb`
This notebook addresses the prediction of future economic values based on time series analysis. While still under development, this module will provide a foundation for forecasting key metrics and anticipating future sales trends.
